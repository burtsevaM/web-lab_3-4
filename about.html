            <p class="text-box-info">The first time we plugged in our amps in Liam's garage, I never imagined we'd actually make it this far. Sarah’s voice cracked on the high notes, and I was sure my guitar solo was a complete mess. We spent years honing our sound in those cramped, sweaty rooms, fueled by cheap pizza and a shared, stubborn dream. I remember looking over at Mark during our first real gig, his eyes wide with a mix of terror and exhilaration as the crowd finally started moving to our rhythm. Now, hearing thousands of voices sing our lyrics back to us, it feels like every single struggle was worth it. This isn't just my story; it's ours, a tapestry woven from our collective chaos and harmony.</p>
